      Welcome to the Track project. This project allows users to register and keep track of a score by "rolling". To register a user, send a x-www-form-urlencoded POST request to /track/register with a parameter called "handle". To view the score of a user, navigate to /track/HANDLE. To roll, visit /track/roll/HANDLE.

      Still confused? Check out <a href="/track/tonynater">/track/tonynater</a> and <a href="/track/roll/tonynater">/track/roll/tonynater</a> to see how the project works.

      I plan on adding a leaderboard in the near future.
