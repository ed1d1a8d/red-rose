      Welcome to the Track project. This project allows users to register and keep track of a score by "rolling". To register a user, send a x-www-form-urlencoded POST request to /track/register with a parameter called "handle". To view the score of a user, navigate to /track/HANDLE. To roll, visit /track/roll/HANDLE.

      Still confused? Check out <a href="/track/score/tonynater" target="_blank">/track/score/tonynater</a> and <a href="/track/roll/tonynater" target="_blank">/track/roll/tonynater</a> to see how the project works.

      This project is built on Amazon DynamoDB. While DynamoDB is a cheap database solution, its interface is extremely cumbersome and difficult to work with. I probably won't be using DynamoDB again anytime in the near future, especially with node.
